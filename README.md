## Getting started

1. Install swiff globally with npm:<br>
`npm install --global swiff`
2. Then run `swiff` within your projects

## Additional features

- Power dev shortcuts: Skip the app interactions by using flags. Run `swiff --help` for the list of flags.
- Custom SSH identity: Swiff will attempt to use your identity located at `/Users/[currentUser]/.ssh/id_rsa`. To use another identity open your project .env file and add `swiffSshKey: '[fullFilePath]'`.
- Trustable backups: Your local database and composer files are backed up before they are replaced.<br>
Run `swiff -b` to view the backups.

## Requirements

Swiff requires mySQL to import the remote database.<br>
You can download mySQL at [dev.mysql.com](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

Running Windows or Linux? So far, Swiff has only been tested macOS so there's probably some issues on other operating systems.
