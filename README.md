## Additional features

- Power dev shortcuts: Run a task without interactions using flags. Run `swiff --help` for the list of flags.

- Custom SSH identity: Swiff will attempt to use your identity located at `/Users/[currentUser]/.ssh/id_rsa`.<br>
Add a custom identity in your .env file with `swiffSshKey: '[fullFilePath]'`.

- Trustable backups: Your local database and composer files are backed up before they are replaced.<br>
Run `swiff -b` to open the backups folder.

## Requirements

Swiff requires mySQL to import the remote database.<br>
You can download mySQL at [dev.mysql.com](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

Running Windows or Linux? So far, Swiff has only been tested macOS so there's probably some issues on other operating systems.
